# SampleTokenizedDepositCordaDLT
An example code snippet that creates a tokenized deposit on Corda using Kotlin.
To use this function, you would need to pass in the deposit amount and the recipient party as parameters. The function then generates a new transaction, creates an output state representing the deposited token, adds the output state and a move command to the transaction, signs and finalizes the transaction, and returns the signed transaction.
